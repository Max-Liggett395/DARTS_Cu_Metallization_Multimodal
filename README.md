# DARTS_Cu_Metallization_Multimodal
This repository contains scripts designed to assist in the Multimodal analysis of photovoltaic cells and evaluate the performance and quality of cells after deposition of Cu gridlines. Inputs include specifications on Cu printing techniques, and processing scripts for illuminated current-voltage, and transfer length method data with automated graphing (by batch, and individual data) as well as outlier detection capabilities. The series of scripts herein were created with the purpose to expedite analysis of phtoovoltaic cells with the additional capability of producing correlation plots to determine optimal recipes for laser sintering of contacts.
